# SER300-Project
---
My project is a mod for the game Stardew Valley. In my mod, I have added 3 new custom crops to the game, all available for purchase at Pierre's shop. In addition, there is also a new tool available at Pierre's shop, the harvesting scythe. This scythe allows the player to harvest crops in a small radius around the player.
