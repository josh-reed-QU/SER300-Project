# SER300- Open Source Project
---
My project is a mod for the game Stardew Valley. In my mod, I have added 3 new custom crops to the game, all available for purchase at Pierre's shop. In addition, there is also a new tool available at Pierre's shop, the harvesting scythe. This scythe allows the player to harvest crops in a small radius around the player. 

I also began to add a second custom tool, a grow wand, that consumes stamina to grow crops in a small radius around the player. The functionality for the tool is correct, but the condition needs to be changed to not apply to other weapons, or the other custom tool. This tool is not in the release version.

### Tech Stack
---
* Visual Studio (C#, .NET, XNA)
* SMAPI

Stardew Valley is a game written in C# using Microsoft's .NET, and XNA frameworks. Because of this, you have to use the same tech stack when developing mods for stardew valley when using SMAPI, the modding API.
